        <p class="letter">In my walk with the Lord, I have had many problems that I didn't know what
            to do. When I had done everything I knew to do, then Jesus was always
            there to see me through. He says when we have done all we know to do
            then stand and wait upon him. The “TRUTH” is the only thing that will
            prosper and be established.</p><br/>

        <p class="letter">In this world we live in, telling the truth is very precious because there are so
            many lying spirits. It's not always easy to tell the truth, but it is so important
            that we do. If we want to be free, the truth is what sets us free. “And ye
            shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free” (St. John 8:32). We
            have to stay in God's word for it is established for ever you can always
            depend on God's word because he cannot lie. (Hebrews 6:18 & Titus 1:2).
            Truth is part of the armor of God. The first peace of armor (Ephesians 6:14)
            stand therefore having you loins girt about with truth. A God who cannot lie
            wants us to tell the truth to one another. “Lie not one to another seeing that
            ye have put off the old man with his deeds” (Colossians 3:9). The Bible
            teaches us to buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and
            understanding (Proverbs 23:23).</p><br/>

        <p class="letter">The whole duty of man let's us hear the conclusion of the whole matter “fear
            god and keep his commandments” (Ecclesiastics 12:13).
