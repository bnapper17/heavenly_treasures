        <h1>Heavenly Treasures Ministries</h1>
        <p>Hey, there! We would like to take a minute to introduce ourselves and let you know what Heavenly Treasures Ministries is all about, how we started, and where (with Gods help) we are headed.<br/><br/> 
        Heavenly Treasures is a Christian ministry started back in 1982 by Lamon and Louella Napper and they were joined by their dear friends Roger and Velma (Bodie) Goosetree and their family. Lamon Napper was an evangelist who preached in countless churches in Indiana and Kentucky. He, along with his wife Louella, traveled the roads, along with their children, several days a week going to revivals, camp meetings, tent meetings, brush harbors, and even door to door to spread the gospel. Their hearts desire was to see as many saved, healed, and delivered as possible! They never gave up on their calling, even though they faced some difficult trials, and their faith and determination to serve God is the reason that Heavenly Treasures Ministries is still alive today!<br/><br/> 
        When Bro. Lamon Napper passed away in 2013 it seemed like it could be the end of Heavenly Treasures Ministries, but as we know, God's plans are always much greater than we could ever hope or dream. In 2014 God started working, once again, in the Napper family and placed a desire in the hearts of Lamon's two sons Michael and David along with their spouses and children to take up the reins and start again. We started ministering, with music first, going wherever there was an open door to encourage Christians and to draw in people who didn't have a personal relationship with God. As soon as we took the first step God was right there to meet us, as He is always faithful to do!<br/><br/> 
        In 2017 Bro. Elmer Starrett along with his wife Sis. Barbara gifted us with a church building in downtown Corydon Indiana. Although we were not really sure how to operate a church we knew that this was a door that God was opening for us so we decided to step through and trusted that God would lead the way. Since then God has done many great things in our ministry and in the individual lives of the members of our group. We have seen souls saved, people healed and delivered, and fellow brothers and sisters in Christ grow stronger, bolder, and more on fire for God than ever before and we have no plans of slowing down!<br/><br/> 
        We believe that Jesus is coming back soon and we want to be about our Fathers business sowing seeds of faith!
