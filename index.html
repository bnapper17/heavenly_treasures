            <h3 id="poem_signature">By: Lamon Napper Sr.</h3>
            <p id="poem_body">Oh Lord, I pray you'll fill my heart and keep me free from sin;
                I pray your light may be so bright that darkness can't get in.
                I pray your joy may fill my soul till sorrows have to flee;
                And that your strength may overcome the weakness that's in me.
                I pray your peace may be so great that troubles cannot dwell;
                And that your love may flow through me like waters from a well.
                I pray you help me understand the things that I must do;
                To grow up in your spirit that I may be like you.</p>

            <h2 class="letter" id="letter_title">From My Heart to Yours with Love & Prayers</h2>
            <p class="letter">In my walk with the Lord, I have had many problems that I didn't know what
                to do. When I had done everything I knew to do, then Jesus was always
                there to see me through. He says when we have done all we know to do
                then stand and wait upon him. The “TRUTH” is the only thing that will
                prosper and be established.</p><br/>

            <p class="letter">In this world we live in, telling the truth is very precious because there are so
                many lying spirits. It's not always easy to tell the truth, but it is so important
                that we do. If we want to be free, the truth is what sets us free. “And ye
                shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free” (St. John 8:32). We
                have to stay in God's word for it is established for ever you can always
                depend on God's word because he cannot lie. (Hebrews 6:18 & Titus 1:2).
                Truth is part of the armor of God. The first peace of armor (Ephesians 6:14)
                stand therefore having you loins girt about with truth. A God who cannot lie
                wants us to tell the truth to one another. “Lie not one to another seeing that
                ye have put off the old man with his deeds” (Colossians 3:9). The Bible
                teaches us to buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and
                understanding (Proverbs 23:23).</p><br/>

            <p class="letter">The whole duty of man let's us hear the conclusion of the whole matter “fear
                god and keep his commandments” (Ecclesiastics 12:13).
